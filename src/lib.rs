//! Service trait : this trait simply translate the idea of a query and an asynch reply.
//!
//! Service Failure is returend as result to the spawner : the inner service process returning `Result` is here
//! for this purpose only. It should respawn or close.
//!
//! Command reply and error are send to another spawnhandle (as a Command).
//!
//! Spawner can loop (for instance a receive stream on an established transport connection) or stop and restart using `State parameter` and command remaining. Or combine both approach, reducing cost of state usage and avoiding stalled loop.
//!
//! Reply and Error are inherent to the command used
//! Service can be spawn using different strategies thrus the Spawn trait.
//!
//! For KVStore state would be initialization function (not function once as must be return ), or
//! builder TODO see kvstore refactoring
//! For peer reader, it would be its stream.
